# Data-Driven Analysis of Employment Conditions and Food Security in the United States (2022 Analysis)

## Research Question
How do employment conditions affect household food security in the United States in 2022?

## Description
This study aims to investigate the relationship between employment characteristics, medical conditions, and demographic factors and their impact on food security status in the United States, using data from 2022. Food security is a critical issue that affects millions of people, and understanding the factors that contribute to food insecurity is essential for developing effective policies and interventions. By analyzing data on demographic characteristics, job conditions, health status, and food security indicators, this project seeks to identify the key determinants of food insecurity and understand how these factors interact to influence food security outcomes. The findings from this analysis will provide valuable insights for policymakers, social service providers, and healthcare organizations, helping them to design targeted interventions that address the root causes of food insecurity and improve the well-being of vulnerable populations.
